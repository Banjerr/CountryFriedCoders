[![Codefresh build status]( https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/build?repoOwner=Banjerr&repoName=CountryFriedCoders&branch=master&pipelineName=CountryFriedCoders&accountName=bengineer_&type=cf-1)]( https://g.codefresh.io/repositories/Banjerr/CountryFriedCoders/builds?filter=trigger:build;branch:master;service:594073249979520001d79554~CountryFriedCoders)

Built using React (Create React App), Webpack, Babel, and Docker. Also using CodeFresh to handle building new images/deploying images to production. Mostly just a playground at this point, and to help learn CI/CD processes with Docker.
